This version of the simulation implements road segments. It is based off of Kenny's networkx_traffic_sim. I changed
1) The names of the modules
2) add_roads
3) I reimplemented the old add_roads for the purposes of declaring the inflow roads
4) I changed some of the parameters for the simulations and visualizations so it would look nicer
5) I made it so that EVERY ROAD GETS A GREEN LIGHT in a random order, because it was messing with the road segments and making the simulation look really choppy. This could be re-implemented, but also I think that THE OLD CODE MAY HAVE NOT BEEN WORKING PROPERLY (only giving three roads a green light?). I'm not sure. 
6) I am probably forgetting stuff.
